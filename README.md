# make-fhir-server

*Under development. Ignore please.*

This repository will contain tools for building a prepopulated FHIR R4 server,
intended for the construction of sandbox environments.
It will build off of the [hapi r4 container](https://hub.docker.com/layers/hapi-5/smartonfhir/hapi-5/r4-empty/images/sha256-42d138f85967cbcde9ed4f74d8cd57adf9f0b057e9c45ba6a8e1713d3f9e1cea?context=explore) by the SMART on FHIR team.
